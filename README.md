utils
=====

a set of small programs that are useful to be inserted in bigger projects, or to be cannibalized, digested and reinterpreted when writing new code.

These are simple things, but writing them back every time or, worse, studying again how do they work, can take away useful time, so why not storing them here?

When I feel inspired, I also put example code for future reference.
